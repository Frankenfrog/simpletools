simpletools example using preselected sWeighted D+,Ds -> phi(KK)pi input data from the first 1.8/nb analysis
This example finds the most powerful variables in the ntuple provided, plots the sWeighted signal and 
background distributions as well as the correlations, plots the efficiencies of a simple cut applied to 
the datasets, and finally runs the cut recursive optimiser to find the best selection cuts. 

To run this example, download and compile the simpletools package: 

1. Get the latest simpletools release from 
/afs/cern.ch.user/c/cofitzpa/public/simpletools/simpletools_XXX.tar.gz

2. extract and compile
tar -xvf simpletools_XXX.tar.gz
cd simpletools_XXX/build
cmake ../
make && make install

If you get an error like ./include/cropFoMs.h:95: error: ‘class TH1D’ has no member named ‘IntegralAndError’ 
then you are using an older version of ROOT. On an LXPlus machine do:

SetupProject Gaudi ROOT

run make again and it should work. 

3. Next you need to add the following to your .bashrc 

SIMPLETOOLS=$HOME/simpletools_XXX  
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SIMPLETOOLS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$SIMPLETOOLS/bin:$PATH

4. Then come back to the example directory and at the bash prompt execute: 

sh tutorial.sh

Inside this shell script is a description of what is happening at each step. 
Feel free to modify the script or input files to see what happens.
